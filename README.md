Coursera Getting and Tidying Data Week 4 Assignment.  
This repository contains a single R program, for analyzing the UCI Human Activity Recognition Dataset
The program takes as input a dataset obtained from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
The data is tidied, by merging the observation data with associated activity and subject datapoints, and combining the "test" and "train" datasets.  The combined dataset is summarized by activity and subject, to produce the mean value of each variable.  The summarized data is written in table form to an output file.
